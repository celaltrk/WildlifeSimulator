# WildlifeSimulator
The wildlife simulation begins with creatures and food spawning in different places. Each creature knows the location of the highest-quality food and moves towards it. The first one to reach the food consumes it. Additional food supplies are introduced at different times. The creatures compete to survive by consuming scattered food resources.
